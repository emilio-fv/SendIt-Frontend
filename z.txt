Documentation Notes
- To set up the frontend, I used Expo, a platform of tools, libraries, and services for building cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript and React.
- Added the following folders:
  app -> will store all of the screens 
  components -> custom react components
  hooks -> custom react hooks
  constants -> constant variables
  styles -> CSS files
- As far as navigation goes, I'm structuring the application around the Home screen. Placing the Home screen at the center will provide a better context for implementing authentication features. When the user opens the app, a check for a user sessions will be done to ensure that only logged in users can navigate to protected routes and access protected resources. If a user is not logged in or their session has expired, they will be redirected to the landing page with prompts to register for an account or login. 
- App Structure:
  Splash screen
    Landing Page 
      Register
      Login
        Home
          Log Climb
          Profile
          Search Users
          Settings
- The app will be broken into the following categories of screens: auth, tabs, and headers
  - Auth screens are screens related to the authentication features: register and login
  - The tabs screens are all the screens related to the tabs found in the bottom navigation bar
  - The headers screens are all related to the icon buttons found in the top headers
